# USB-2-PCE

This repository is a placeholder for where the open source code will live for the USB-2-PCE controller adapter. For now this repo will be used for issue tracking and firmware releases with proper change logs.

## Firmware Update Instructions

1. Disconnected adapter from the console and all connected USB devices.
2. While holding the boot(+) button, connect the USB-C port to a computer.
3. A virual drive called RPI-RP2 will appear, drag-n-drop the UF2 update file onto the drive.
4. The virtual drive will automatically unmount when the update is completed. ðŸš€

## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you run into any issues, then please submit a bug report on the issues tab of this repo. If you would like to see support for specific USB controllers or think of something I missed, then you are welcome to open a feature request under the issues tab. Don't be shy. ðŸ‘‚
